# Transfer Learning with ResNet for Image Manipulation

This is a data science project where we explore the concept of transfer learning using the ResNet neural network architecture to manipulate images. The main objective of this project is to demonstrate how we can trick ResNet, a state-of-the-art image classification model, into misclassifying a frog image as an automobile. Please follow the instructions below to understand the project and reproduce the results.

## Project Overview

In this project, we will use the ResNet model pre-trained on a large dataset (such as ImageNet) and leverage transfer learning to fine-tune it on our custom dataset containing images of frogs and automobiles. By manipulating the model's parameters, we aim to change its perception and make it misclassify frog images as automobiles.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Download the custom dataset containing frog and automobile images and place it in the 'data' directory. Please make sure the dataset is organized in separate subdirectories for each class.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook file 'main.ipynb'.

## Important Note

This project is purely for educational and illustrative purposes. The intention is to demonstrate the concept of transfer learning and image manipulation using deep learning techniques. Please use this code responsibly and do not deploy any manipulated models in real-world applications.
